# tensorflow-1.13.1-ubuntu16.04-py27-no_avx-westmere

Tensorflow 1.13.1 wheel built for Python 2.7 without GPU on Ubuntu
16.04 running on a Westmere CPU that does not support AVX instructions
(one generation older than Sandy Bridge).

Usage:

```
pip install tensorflow-1.13.1-cp27-cp27mu-linux_x86_64.whl
```

This could be useful if your CPU is too old for the official Tensorflow package
on PyPI.
